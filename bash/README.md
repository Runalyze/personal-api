# Runalyze Personal API - Bash Examples


## `upload-activities.sh`
Put the `upload-activities.sh` into a folder with your activities (fit,tcx,gpx, ttbin, fitlog) and call the script
`upload-activities.sh <token>`

Activities will be uploaded to Runalyze. Don't forget - Activities will be queued - So you won't see the activities immediately.
